# Floating Clock Widget

A simple, floating, always-on-top desktop clock built with Python and Tkinter.  
Designed to display live time in any selected timezone via a dropdown menu.  
This project was created as a personal learning journey — to understand application structure, Python packaging, and cross-platform deployment.

## Features

- Always-on-top floating clock window  
- Selectable timezones via dropdown (major world cities)  
- Draggable window  
- Dark-themed minimalist design  
- Built using only Python standard libraries (`tkinter`, `zoneinfo`, `datetime`)  
- Packaged into standalone `.exe` and Linux binaries using PyInstaller

## Motivation & Learning Goals

This project was built to:

- Learn **Python** through a small but complete application  
- Understand **GUI development** with `tkinter`  
- Practice **timezone-aware programming** using `zoneinfo`  
- Learn to use **virtual environments**, `requirements.txt`, and Python packaging tools  
- Explore **PyInstaller** to create platform-specific binaries  
- Prepare a mini-project for my GitHub profile to reflect my growth as a developer
